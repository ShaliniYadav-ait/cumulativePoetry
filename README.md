This code shows the cumulative poetry.
If the poem is 
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth.
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear.
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference."

Flags supported

--reveal-for-day for_which_day : Reveals the tale for that day
--recite : Recites the whole tale with a day wise breakage

Here command : "go run . --reveal-for-day 2" will reveal the following :                   
"Day 2 - 
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could"

and "go run . --recite" will give the following result :                                

"Day 1 - 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
Day 2 - 
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
Day 3 - 
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
Day 4 - 
To where it bent in the undergrowth.
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear.
Day 5 - 
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Day 6 - 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference."
